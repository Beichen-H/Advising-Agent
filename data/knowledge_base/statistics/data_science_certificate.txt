The Certificate in Data Science option allows undergraduate students to receive recognition 
for completing coursework that provides an understanding of data science including exposure 
to data structures and data sources, statistical principles, computing and analytics, data 
management, and data science applications.

Students completing the Certificate will be presented with an official certificate document 
and may use this credential on a CV, resume, or application for advanced study.

ELIGIBILITY:
------------
Students pursuing an X+DS Major or Data Science Minor are NOT eligible for this certificate.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
Complete at least FOUR courses from the Approved List below. No course substitutions will be approved.

All courses applied to the certificate may also be counted toward the requirements of the 
student's declared major or minor. Students are not guaranteed a seat in courses, but may 
enroll when seats remain after restrictions are removed.
