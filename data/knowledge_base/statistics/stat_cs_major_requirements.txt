This major is designed for students who would like a strong foundation in computer science, 
coupled with significant advanced coursework in statistics. The major prepares students for 
professional or graduate work in statistics and computer science, and for applications of 
computing in which knowledge of statistics is particularly important, such as data mining 
and machine learning.
