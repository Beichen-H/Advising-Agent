The Data Science Minor is designed to provide students with an understanding of data science, 
including statistical analysis and inference, computation, and business intelligence. It will 
assist students with their major field of study to apply tools of quantitative analysis and 
data fluency in that field.

ELIGIBILITY:
------------
All University of Illinois undergraduate students are eligible to earn the Minor in Data Science, 
EXCEPT for those enrolled in a BS degree program for an X+DS major.

MAJOR AND MINOR OVERLAP:
------------------------
- Requires at least SIX hours of advanced (300 or 400 level) course credit distinct from 
  credit earned for any major or another minor
- You must have at least TWO upper-level courses that count ONLY towards the minor

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
- Linear Algebra (one of MATH 225, MATH 227, MATH 257, MATH 415, MATH 416, ASRM 406) is required 
  before taking CS 307
- Calculus I (one of MATH 220, MATH 221, MATH 234) is recommended before CS 307
- Check Course Explorer for all prerequisite requirements

REGISTRATION NOTES:
-------------------
- Pursuing a Data Science Minor does NOT grant priority registration rights
- Check Course Explorer for restriction details and release timelines

MINOR REQUIREMENTS (Minimum 21 credit hours, excluding prerequisites):

   - CS 307: Modeling and Learning in Data Science (4 hours)
     Note: Requires Linear Algebra prerequisite

2. Domain Specific Data Science (Choose TWO courses):
   - ATMS 207: Weather and Climate Data Science (3 hours)
   - CS 225: Data Structures (4 hours)
   - CS 277: Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science (4 hours)
     *Students may use credit from CS 225 or CS 277, but not both*
   - CS 416: Data Visualization (3 hours)
   - CS 441: Applied Machine Learning (3 hours)
   - GGIS 407: Foundations of CyberGIS & Geospatial Data Science (4 hours)
   - IS 357: Introduction to Data Storytelling (3 hours)
   - IS 417: Data Science in the Humanities (3 hours)
   - IS 445: Data Visualization (3 hours)
   - LING 406: Introduction to Computational Linguistics (3 hours)
   - STAT 432: Basics of Statistical Learning (3 hours)
   - STAT 440: Statistical Data Management (3 hours)
   - STAT 447: Data Science Programming Methods (3 hours)
   - STAT 480: Big Data Analytics (3 hours)

3. Data Ethics (Choose ONE):
   - IS 467: Ethics and Policy for Data Science (3 hours)
   - IS 477: Data Management, Curation & Reproducibility (3 hours)

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
---------------------------
Q: Can I substitute a different course?
A: No substitutions are accepted in the DS Minor at this time.

Q: Can courses count toward both my major and the minor?
A: Yes, as long as you have TWO advanced courses that are distinct to the minor.

Q: I'm a Statistics major - can I use STAT 4XX electives in both?
A: Yes. For Statistics majors, the distinct hours requirement is met with CS 307 and the Ethics requirement.

Q: Are these courses interchangeable as prerequisites?
A: No. Check Course Explorer for specific prerequisite requirements.

Q: Can I take a course without satisfying prerequisites?
A: No. Some courses enforce prerequisites and will prevent registration.
