The Statistics minor is designed to provide students with an understanding of the concepts of 
statistical inference and a familiarity with the methods of applied statistical analysis. 
A minor in statistics will assist students with their major field of study and prepare them 
for graduate studies where data analysis plays an important role.

ELIGIBILITY:
------------
All University of Illinois undergraduate students are eligible to earn the Minor in Statistics, 
EXCEPT for those enrolled in the Statistics or Statistics & Computer Science majors.

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
To complete all required courses, students will need to take calculus through at least MATH 231.
